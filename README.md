Modular-VA is a full python modular voice assistant. This project was forked from the similar project Jasper (https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client). The main (planned) differences are:
- The use of python 3
- Replacement of all the speech recognition internal handling (recording, etc.) with a newer speech recognition package (https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition)
- Newer STT engine (through said speech recognition package)

This is a work in progress, other changes might come in the future.
